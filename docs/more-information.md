Tepl - more information
=======================

About versions and API
----------------------

The API is now **constantly unstable**, there can be API breaks for new
versions. As a consequence, it is highly recommended to **bundle** Tepl with the
program, and for the program to depend on a precise version of Tepl.

Dependencies
------------

- GLib 2
- GTK 3
- GtkSourceView 4
- [Amtk](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amtk) 5
- [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/)

Documentation
-------------

See the `gtk_doc` Meson option. A convenient way to read the API documentation
is with the [Devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp) application.

See also other files in this directory for additional notes.

Development and maintenance
---------------------------

If you want to see Tepl improved, you are encouraged to contribute. The
maintainer will do its best at reviewing merge requests. However, contributions
need to follow the roadmap of Tepl or the general philosophy of the project.

About versions

For example the `6.3.x` versions are development snapshots, and the `6.4.x`
series is stable.

There are sometimes API or ABI breaks, in which case the library soname is
adapted.

From [Gedit Technology](https://gedit-technology.net/):

- Amtk

Documentation

See the `gtk_doc` Meson option. A convenient way to read the API documentation
is with the [Devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp) application.

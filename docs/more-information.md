Tepl - more information
=======================

About versions
--------------

Tepl follows the even/odd minor version scheme.

For example the `6.3.x` versions are development snapshots, and the `6.4.x`
series is stable.

There are sometimes API or ABI breaks, in which case the library soname is
adapted.

Dependencies
------------

- GTK 3
- [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/)

From [Gedit Technology](https://gedit-technology.net/):
- libgedit-gtksourceview
- Amtk

Documentation
-------------

See the `gtk_doc` Meson option. A convenient way to read the API documentation
is with the [Devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp) application.

See also other files in this directory for additional notes.

Development and maintenance

need to follow the roadmap of Tepl or the general philosophy of the project.

News in 2.99.2, 2017-07-18
--------------------------

Amtk:
* The biggest change in this release is that the classes and functions related
  to actions and menus have been moved to a new shared library called Amtk
  (Actions, Menus and Toolbars Kit), since it was not really related to text
  editors, it is more general. But Amtk is still developed inside the Tepl
  repository. Amtk is a basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction (still
  under development, it is not yet finished, for example it doesn't handle
  toolbars).
* Add AmtkFactory and AmtkFactoryMenu, which replace
  amtk_action_info_store_create_menu_item().

Framework:
* Revamp TeplTab.
* Add TeplTabGroup interface.
* Add TeplNotebook that implements TeplTabGroup.

News in 1.99.2, 2017-03-12
--------------------------
This is an unstable release leading towards 2.0. The 2.0 stable version will be
released at the same time as GNOME 3.24.

Basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction:
* Add an easy way to create a GtkMenuItem from a GtefActionInfo.
* Add a function to check that every GtefActionInfo in a GtefActionInfoStore
  has been used.
* Add reference counting to GtefActionInfo.

  gtef_application_get_app_action_info_store().
* Add GtefMenuShell, an extension of GtkMenuShell with the ::menu-item-selected
  and ::menu-item-deselected signals.
* Add gtef_menu_item_get/set_long_description().
* Add GtefApplicationWindow, an extension of GtkApplicationWindow with:
	* A statusbar property.
	* A function to connect a GtefMenuShell to the statusbar,
	  pushing/popping the long descriptions of GtkMenuItems when they are
	  selected/deselected.
	* A function to connect a GtkRecentChooserMenu to the statusbar,
	  pushing/popping the full paths.
	* A function to create a GtkMenuItem with a simple and generic
	  GtkRecentChooserMenu as submenu.

Misc:

  Editor Framework”.

  https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gtef
  The bugzilla product is not yet created.
* Add Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Swedish, Indonesian and German
  translations.

News in 1.99.1, 2017-01-26
--------------------------
This is an unstable release leading towards 2.0. The 2.0 stable version will be
released at the same time as GNOME 3.24.

File loading and saving:
* Finish the first usable version of the new GtefFileLoader.
* Use etags instead of mtime.
* GtefFileSaver: do not use an heuristic to know if it's a "save as" operation.
* Add GtefEncoding, a fork of GtkSourceEncoding to suit the needs of the new
  file loader.
* Re-usable code outside of GtkTextView: GtefFileContentLoader and
  GtefEncodingConverter (private classes).
* Various other small improvements.

Various features for text editors:
* Add GtefBuffer:gtef-style-scheme-id property.
* Add gtef_view_select_lines().
* Add gtef_view_goto_line() and gtef_view_goto_line_offset().
* Add gtef_iter_get_line_indentation().
* The GtefInfoBar class has been revamped.

Starting a basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction:
* Add gtef_utils_menu_item_set_icon_name()
* Add GtefActionInfo
* Add GtefActionInfoStore
* Note that those classes are a little out of scope for a text editor library.
  I would be happy to move those classes to a better library once the feature
  is finished and well-tested. The classes were added to Gtef for convenience.

Framework:
* Add gtef namespace to GtefBuffer signals and properties to avoid potential
  conflicts with future GtkSourceView versions.
* Add GtefApplication with gtef_application_get_action_info_store().

Documentation:
* Add an intro with the pkg-config name.
* List API breaks.

Misc:
* Improvements to the build system.

News in 1.0.0, 2016-10-26
-------------------------

This is the first version of Gtef.

File loading and saving:
* Save and load file metadata. If GVfs is not available, there is a fallback
  implementation with an XML file (used e.g. on Windows).
* A new file loader based on uchardet (implementation not completely finished).

Starting the framework:
* GtefBuffer, a subclass of GtkSourceBuffer with additional features.
* GtefView, a subclass of GtkSourceView with additional features.
* GtefTab, contains a GtefView with GtkInfoBars on top.
* GtefInfoBar, a subclass of GtkInfoBar.

Starting code folding:
* GtefGutterRendererFolds, a basic gutter renderer for code folding.
* GtefFoldRegion, a foldable region in a GtkTextBuffer.
